## TODO
- [ ] reorganize main code out of notebooks
		(put into folders/.py files & use nb for training/testing exploration/visualization)
	- maybe also use something pytorch lightning
- [ ] put more content into previous paper implementations (training/testing notes, etc)
	- retraining older notebooks (i've learned a lot more sense then, so can improve results probably & tidy up code)
